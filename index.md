## Welcome to Categoric

My name is James King. I have been doing some work to migrate data from unstructured formats to structured ones. My work is steeped in category theory and I aim to preserve 100% of your data using tools I'm developing. If you have a non-critical project without any hard deadlines and could afford to toss me a few hundred dollars to give you a chance to leverage that pile of data, please get in touch with me!

Fill out the form below, tell me about your data problem, and I'll see if I can help.
